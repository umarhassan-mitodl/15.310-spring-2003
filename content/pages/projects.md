Undergraduate students enrolled in 15.301 are required to complete a group project. The following was used as the project topic in Spring 2003.

No Parking or Frayed Tempers in the Sloan Lot
---------------------------------------------

*   Organizations must often provide services for multiple constituencies with conflicting objectives.
*   Parking is a good example.
*   Devise (or find) a general approach to solving such problems.
*   Apply it to this example.
*   Critique the applicability of the approach to other settings.
